# Breast-Cancer-Detection-using-CNN
Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer affecting women worldwide. Early detection of breast cancer is crucial for effective treatment and increasing the survival rate of patients. Over the years, various medical imaging techniques have been used for breast cancer detection, including mammography, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Recently, deep learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have shown promising results in medical image analysis and have been widely used in breast cancer detection. CNNs can learn high-level representations of medical images and identify patterns that may be missed by human observers.

In this project we have used CNN for breast cancer detection and tried to classify image dataset into benign and malignant cells. The use of CNNs in breast cancer detection has the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis, reducing the need for invasive procedures such as biopsies.
